# SBIO_Tools
SBIO Tools are simple python bioinformatic tools written by me to either pull simple genome assembly stats or create fast and ready graphs
using the pythons seaborn module.

# Scripts
Contains basic scripts to pull information. 

# Graphing
Contains basic scripts with textual user interfaces for quick graphing.

# Note
Due to python 2.7 being discontinued in 2020. All programs will be transcribed to python 3. Newer scripts will also be written in python 3.
